                <h2>GREAT SCIENTIST</h2>
                <P><b>Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955)</b>was a German-born theoretical physicist. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics, and thus to modern physics.His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation" His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. Einsteinium, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers.These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativity, and demonstrated that mass and energy are equivalent to each other. He thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.[14][15] He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.</P>
